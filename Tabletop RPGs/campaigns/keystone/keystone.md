# Haven

The player characters are encouraged to come up with their own reasons for warming their bones at **[[Plot/Quests/The Rusty Anchor Tavern|The Rusty Anchor Tavern]]**, in the town of **Sandyport**, on the quiet island of **Haven**, about a day's sail from the coast, in the **Kingdom of Elvandar**. (How's that for worldbuilding?)
