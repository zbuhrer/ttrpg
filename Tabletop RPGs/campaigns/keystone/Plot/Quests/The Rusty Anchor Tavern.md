However the PCs know each other, they are eventually approached by a grizzled character in a tattered tri-corner hat. He wears a cape and cowl that don't hide the trappings of a pirate. He introduces himself as **[[../../Creatures/NPCs/Captain Hector Cavendish#Statblock|Captain Hector Cavendish]]** of the Serpent Star. He noticed the PCs equipment from across the tavern floor and thought he might have found just who he was looking for...

Captain Cavendish reveals that twenty years ago, when he was a young adventurer himself... he was hired to find an powerful and dangerous artifact: **The Celestial Keystone**. To this day he has not succeeded in his quest.

Many have joined his tireless quest over the years and either died or left when it seemed clear that the quest was impossible.
