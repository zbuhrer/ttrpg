## About

This small winged humanoid has soot-colored skin, crimson eyes, and dark wings. Small trails of smoke stream from its body as it flies along.

Smoke mephits are generally only encountered on the Plane of Molten Skies, though it is believed they originate from a plane or para-plane comprised entirely of smoke. They are generally lazy, but quick to anger.

When encountered on the Material Plane it is usually because they have been summoned or called by a spellcaster to perform some task or chore.

On such planes, smoke mephits generally prefer warmer climates and are never found in cold areas (unless specifically called by a spellcaster).

Smoke mephits enjoy combat and rush headlong into it, slashing with their claws. If a smoke mephit can draw its opponents to within 20 feet of its position, it uses its spell-like abilities to create an ember storm.

A smoke mephit stands about 4 feet tall and weighs about 2 pounds.
