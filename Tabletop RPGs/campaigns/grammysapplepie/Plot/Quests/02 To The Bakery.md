## Detailed Description

### The Road to the Bakery

The map reveals that it is about two days ride to the bakery. There is a small town nearby where the players can stock up on any general goods they feel they might need (no magic items are to be found in the marketplace there, but anything from the Player’s Handbook equipment and gear tables are fair game). The trip can pass uneventfully, or the DM may choose to roll a d6 on the following table for a random encounter.

| d6  | Encounter    |
| --- | ------------ |
| 1   | Rust monster |
| 2   | Giant spider |
| 3   | Black bear   |
| 4   | Bugbear      |
| 5   | Blink dog    |
| 6   | Vine blight  |

### 0 - Outside
For every ten minutes the group spends walking around outside the bakery, roll a d6 to find out if they encounter a patrol group of 1d4 goblins. On a 6, the goblins see them first and try to run away. On a 1, the group sees the goblins before they are spotted, and they can decide what to do from there.

### 1 - Entrance
> “As you approach the large stone building, the road turns into a gravel path surrounded by an overgrown lawn, leading toward a large set of wooden double doors. The fragrance of ripening apples is thick in the air from the old apple orchard in the back. There is one massive apple tree near the path to the front doors. As the wind whistles through the long grasses, you notice that the bark of the tree looks almost like an ancient, wizened face.”

The tree is an apple [[../../../../5eSRD/Monsters/Treant|Treant]] named Mac, or Macintosh. He is grumpy and old, and has very little patience for the antics of youngsters. He knows of the goblins inside the building, but does not particularly care, since they ignore him. If any of the players poses a threat to any of the other trees or plants in the area, Mac is now hostile towards them. He aims only to incapacitate and never to kill, but he will not tolerate any harm to nature in his presence. He can, at will, awaken the nine shrubs in the front of the building to go and pester the party. With DC 12 Investigate or Charisma checks, he reveals that he doesn’t know about any secret recipes, but he remembers that old Grammy used to chat every day with the dryads who live out back in the old orchard, and suggests that they might know something. 

The set of doors is loosely barred from the inside, as the goblins primarily use the back entrance. The wood is rotting and it can be broken open with a DC 14 Strength check.

### 2 - Apple Orchard
> “The scent of apples is even thicker here. The older trees are arranged in neat orderly rows, but the saplings that have sprouted since the goblins took over are everywhere. There is a whispering sound that doesn’t seem to come from just the leaves rustling in the wind. Early ripened apples litter the ground. As you approach, one of them flies through the air, narrowly missing your heads. The sound of whispering is joined by the sound of giggling.”

The three dryads who live in the orchard are mischievous, but reclusive. They won’t come out to talk without an offering of a gift, or a DC 13 Persuasion check. They don’t like to give much information, but they also really don’t like those disgusting goblins. It takes a DC 17 Persuasion or Investigation check for them to reveal that half the secret recipe is in the front office and half is in Grammy’s apartment. If they like the party, they can also reveal that they have a better chance of surprising the goblins if they go in through the loading dock. If the party in some way offends the dryads, they pelt them with half-rotten apples until they leave, or until the dryads get bored.

### 3 - Waste Pile
> “What was once an orderly row of compost and waste bins has long since been heaped up into a massive trash pile. It is overgrown with fungus and other decomposers taking advantage of the ready supply of food. It smells rancid, the odor being carried on the breeze.”

If anyone comes within 5 feet of the waste pile, a violet fungus slowly oozes out (moving at half speed) and must be either fought or avoided.

### 4 - Shop
> “The shop is a small front area of the bakery where the famous pies could be sold directly to hungry customers. A counter at the back of the room stands surrounded by shelves on every wall. It appears that while the shelves once held lovely packages of pies, they have long since been ransacked; paper boxes and bits of ribbon and twine litter the floor. Two small tables have been overturned in the center of the room. There is a door on either side of the room, as well as the large double doors that lead outside.”

There are many signs of goblin infestation in the room that could be used to track the goblins living here. If the party searches the counter area, a DC 12 Perception check will find a locked cashbox. It will require a DC 14 Sleight of Hand check to pick the lock, or DC 16 Strength to simply smash it open. It contains 8 gp, 11 sp, and 21 cp.

### 5 - Office
> “This well-appointed room of sturdy mahogany furniture and velvet curtains contains two paper-strewn desks with overturned chairs. The remaining walls are lined with bookshelves and filing cabinets. The goblin odor is not as strong in here as it is in other areas of the bakery.”

The goblins cannot read and see no use for stupid papers except as kindling for fires, and there’s plenty of that outside. The bookshelves contain records of the bakery’s finances (business was booming). A DC 13 Perception check will find the safe hidden behind one of the shelves. DC 15 Sleight of Hand check is required to pick the lock, or DC 17 Strength to pry it open. The safe contains 75 gp, 50 sp, and 25 cp.

One of the desk drawers is trapped, but the mechanism can be spotted with a DC 13 Perception check. A DC 16 Dexterity check will disarm the trap. If the drawer is opened without disarming it, a poison needle springs out of the drawer to stab whoever is opening it. It does 1 piercing damage and 1d10 poison damage. The victim will also need to make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw to avoid being poisoned for one hour. This drawer contains one half of the secret recipe on a torn up old parchment scroll.

Other drawers contain blank paper, quills, ink, etc. There is one silver signet ring worth about 10 gp. The curtains are still in decent condition and could probably fetch another 10 gp at the market, but they are heavy and cumbersome.

The furniture would fetch a pretty penny indeed but is far too heavy to be moved without assistance.

### 6 - Guard Room
> “Although there was little need for it, Grammy kept two or three young men from the nearby town employed as guards, more to keep them out of trouble than anything else. This room is where they kept their equipment and took breaks during long night patrols. Three quarterstaffs have fallen to the floor from where they once stood against one wall. There is a small table with two chairs, all of which have been overturned. A locked chest sits opposite the quarterstaffs.”

The quarterstaffs are not in great condition, due to the wood not being preserved. If the party chooses to take and use them, roll a d6 when an attack made with one of them fails. On a 5 or 6, the staff breaks. The chest requires a DC 15 Dexterity check to pick the lock or a DC 17 Strength check to smash the lock off. Inside are three bottles of Shillelagh oil, which will work as if casting the spell Shillelagh when rubbed on a club or quarterstaff.

### 7 - Loading Dock

> “A sliding wooden door opens into a room with bare stone floors and plain walls. An empty wagon stands abandoned in the room, gathering dust. You can see, within the bakery, packing and shipping pallets that stand ready to be loaded onto the wagon. As you watch, a patrol of two goblins walks by, oblivious.”

If the party, on average, succeeds at a DC 13 Stealth check, the goblins continue on their patrol with no notice. If they do not, one of the goblins stops, sniffs the air, and declares that he smells something funny, and they come in to investigate.

### 8 - Bakery Floor
> “The bakery floor is a wide open space with high ceilings with exposed wooden beams, sound echoing throughout the room. Two stone rooms stand to one side with heavy barred doors keeping them closed. Between them is a small glass cabinet with an even smaller mallet hanging on a chain. Six long work benches fill the center of the room, covered with pie tins, rolling pins, and other baking equipment. Some of the rolling pins are still rolling lazily back and forth, some enchantment keeping them in motion. Dulled knives chop at apples that haven’t been there in years. On the other side are six massive ovens, their doors still opening periodically, as if remembering that they are supposed to. Tall chimneys rise from each oven to pierce the ceiling overhead. The whole area is the mess, not the work of a professional baker. It looks as if someone has tried and failed to teach themselves to make pie.”

The glass cabinet contains two regular healing potions. The magic baking equipment might be able to fetch a few coppers as a curio for some interested wizard, but otherwise is in poor condition. The non-magical baking equipment wouldn’t even be able to get that, so much of it is eaten through with rust and rot. A Mending cantrip may be able to fix some of the physical damage, but it cannot restore or strengthen any magic.

The stone rooms, one used for ingredient storage and one for finished product storage, are mostly empty, but the runes inscribed in the stone are still keeping the rooms chilled. These runes can be copied by any magic users in the party. It is a second level spell, a variation on Cone of Cold which only lowers the temperature enough to cool food, not enough to do damage. A DC 15 Perception check will find several bags of exotic spices hidden away in a corner - a bag each of cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, and cloves. Each one is worth about 5 gp. 

The goblins have been attempting to replicate Grammy’s pies - which they have become addicted to. If the party attempts to interfere in any way with the magical objects, three goblins drop down from the rafters to stop them. They can be reasoned with and negotiated with, if the party agrees to show them the recipe. They cannot read, but they will remember things they are told verbally or that are demonstrated to them. DC 14 Charisma, Persuasion, or Intimidation, if that’s more your party’s style. The goblins are not smart, and are easily deceived, but they will have a long memory of this deception. Or it comes to fighting, although the goblins do not wish to instigate combat. 

The ovens are still warm, but not hot, and certainly not hot enough to bake a pie (as evidenced by some half-baked messes in pie tins sitting on top of them). This is not due to magic, but by the residence of some creatures who find ovens very conveniently hospitable. They are comfortable and do not attack unless provoked. Roll a d4 on the following table:

| d4  | Encounter                                                       |
| --- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | 1d3 (1d6 halved) [[../../../../5eSRD/Monsters/Magmin\|Magmins]] |
| 2   | 1d4 Smoke [[../../../../5eSRD/Monsters/Magma Mephit\|Mephits]]  |
| 3   | 1d4 [[../../../../5eSRD/Monsters/Magma Mephit\|Magma Mephits]]  |
| 4   | 1 fire snake                                                    |

### 9 - Grammy's Apartment

> “This once homey apartment where the famed Grammy used to reside has been turned into a true goblin hovel. Two goblins and their leader stand in the middle of the room, staring at you. Ancient mahogany furniture still stands in the room, too heavy for the goblins to move. A bed, missing a mattress stands in one corner. A wardrobe, now filled with crude weapons, is in the opposite corner. Against one wall is a desk, covered in animal pelts and hunting trophies.”

These goblins (two regular goblins and one chief) can be negotiated with or fought. One of the desk drawers is trapped, but can be spotted with a DC 13 Perception check. A DC 16 Dexterity check will disarm the trap. If the drawer is opened without disarming it, a poison needle springs out of the drawer to stab whoever is opening it. It does 1 piercing damage and 1d10 poison damage. The victim will also need to make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw to avoid being poisoned for one hour. This drawer contains one half of the secret recipe on a torn up old parchment scroll. It also contains a small spellbook - more like a spell notebook - containing the few spells that old Grammy knew: Druidcraft, Entangle, Purify Food and Drink, and Speak with Plants.
