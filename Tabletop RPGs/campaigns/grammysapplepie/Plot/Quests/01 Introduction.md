## Involved NPCs

## Detailed Description
The players have been summoned, whether individually or as an assembled party, to a wizard’s tower with the promise of a paying job. The wizard’s imp servant has led them into the tower and shown them up to the wizard’s study. 

**Read the following aloud:**

> “Although you were initially distrustful when the imp appeared at the door to let you into the old wizard’s tower, inside you have seen enough benign wonders to assuage your concerns. At the top of a long and winding staircase is the wizard’s study. Within, you see a room lined with bookshelves, and a desk covered with bubbling potions, mysterious trinkets, and ink-stained scraps of parchment. An elderly man with long, wispy, white hair, milky eyes, and a large hooked nose sits in a cozy chair behind the desk. He very slowly stands up and introduces himself as [[../../Creatures/NPCs/Tyndareus the Green|Tyndareus the Green]]. He pours you each a cup of tea and finally tells you why he summoned you here.
> 
> When I was a boy,’ he says, smacking his lips, ‘I tasted the most wonderful treat in all the Material Plane. I remember it like it was yesterday. Grammy’s Country Apple Pies… The bakery was near my hometown and you could smell the spices all day and night, no matter where you were in town. Alas, when I went away to wizard college, the place was overrun by goblins and no one has dared go back in since. I’d like to taste those heavenly pies just once more before I depart for the Celestial Plane. If I give you a map to the bakery, can you go in and find Grammy’s secret recipe for me?’”

If the players inquire as to what their reward will be, the wizard informs them that although he has little gold, there will be gold for them at the end, and he tells them that they can keep anything of value they might find in the bakery.  All he wants is the recipe.
