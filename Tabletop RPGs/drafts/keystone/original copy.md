## Chapter 1
### Rusty Anchor Tavern
:
&nbsp;&nbsp;The player characters are encouraged to come up with their own reasons for warming their bones at the **Rusty Anchor**, in the town of **Sandyport**, on the quiet island of **Haven**, about a day's sail from the coast, in the **Kingdom of Elvandar**. (How's that for worldbuilding?)
:
&nbsp;&nbsp;However the PCs know each other, they are eventually approached by a grizzled character in a tattered tri-corner hat. He wears a cape and cowl that don't hide the trappings of a pirate. He introduces himself as **Captain Hector Cavendish** of the Serpent Star. He noticed the PCs equipment from across the tavern floor and thought he might have found just who he was looking for.
:
&nbsp;&nbsp;He buys everyone currently at the table a drink.

:
&nbsp;&nbsp;Captain Cavendish reveals that twenty years ago, when he was a young adventurer himself... he was hired to find an powerful and dangerous artifact: **The Celestial Keystone**. To this day he has not succeeded in his quest.
:
&nbsp;&nbsp;Many have joined his tireless quest over the years and either died or left when it seemed clear that the quest was impossible.
:::
{{note
#### The Celestial Keystone 
:
&nbsp;&nbsp;**The Celestial Keystone** is a powerful magical artifact that is said to hold the power to grant godhood to its wielder. It is said to be a small, crystal sphere with swirling, iridescent energies that pulse and shift within it. Legend has it that the Keystone was created by the gods themselves as a way to test the worthiness of mortals who seek to join their ranks.
:
&nbsp;&nbsp;According to legend, the Keystone has the ability to amplify and focus magical energy, making it extremely powerful and sought after by those who seek to increase their own magical abilities. However, it is also said that the Keystone is highly unstable and dangerous, and those who try to use it without proper caution and preparation risk unleashing devastating magical energies that could destroy entire worlds.
:
&nbsp;&nbsp;Many believe that the Keystone is hidden in a secret location, guarded by powerful beings or treacherous traps. Some believe that the Keystone is protected by ancient and powerful magical wards that can only be unlocked by solving a series of riddles or completing a series of quests. Others believe that the Keystone is hidden in a place so remote or dangerous that it can only be reached by those who are truly dedicated and brave enough to pursue it.

&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a placeholder for... if for some reason the PCs don't accept Cavendish's offer. Maybe something silly happens and they have to find the Keystone anyway. They should accept it though. C'mon guys.
:
&nbsp;&nbsp;He offers the party 5000 gp to join him. Half now, half when they get there. And they have to leave tonight. Now, even. Gather your things.
:::
### Oh Shit! Skeletons!
:
&nbsp;&nbsp;If a player is outside, any Passive Perception above a 5 would notice the clattering of loose bones and rusty armor as a seemingly unending horde of skeletons slowly begin to creep up from the shoreline. If the party is all still inside, they may hear a scream from the street or if they're particularly drunk or unobservant a skeleton might just crash through the window by their table!
:
&nbsp;&nbsp;The undead climb up over the wood of the dock, they shamble up the rocky shore, inland from seemingly every direction, the town is beset by skeletons.

&nbsp;&nbsp;The players are unable to discern any motives from the skeletons by magical means or otherwise. Enough skeletons will engage the players in order to keep them occupied, the rest of the skeletons will search the town.
:
&nbsp;&nbsp;With a sufficient **Investigation** roll, a player may notice that the skulls of the skeletons are marked with a sigil. Captain Cavendish would recognize it as the Sigil of Arathax, a Lich who hasn't been seen in decades. He was once freed from his icy prison by adventurers who sought his power and it took several powerful wizards to get him back under lock and key. He hadn't been seen or heard from since. At least, until now.
:
&nbsp;&nbsp;The Captain may be willing to admit that the reason he's in this town in the first place is because he was following a lead; there's a rumor that a map to where the Keystone is hidden was drawn by a local in this village after having a prophetic dream.
:
&nbsp;&nbsp;It's true, this did happen. Barnaby, a local just psychically sensitive enough recieved a prophetic dream warning of an apocalypse, skeletons rising from the sea, and of a great stone doorway being destroyed. He wrote all of this down, even doodling a crude map, and took it to the library late last night. In the basement of the library is a chest which the PCs will have to open to find Barnaby'a prophecy.
:
\column
:::::::::::::::::::::::::
&nbsp;&nbsp;The librarian and the tavern barkeep know about Barnaby's prophecy, but Barnaby himself is slain in the skeleton attack (looking any deeper would show that he killed himself before the skeletons could drag him away). 
:
&nbsp;&nbsp;Reading the map reveals through some unwrittenly cryptic means that the Keystone can be found in/through a mythical labyrinth beneath a city that someone with regional knowledge will recognize was changed to Arvandor 200 years ago.
:
&nbsp;&nbsp;The Captain plots a course for the Capital.

<!-- CHAPTER 2: A MAGICIAN'S MISHAP

The party arrives in the capital city of Arvandor and begins to search for the entrance to the dungeon where the Celestial Keystone is rumored to be hidden. As they explore the marketplace and interact with various NPCs, they come across a clumsy freelance magician named Filbert who is attempting to cast a powerful spell. Filbert, a gnome who is barely able to control his magic, invites the party to join him in the spellcasting.

As the party assists Filbert, he loses control of the spell and it goes awry, causing a burst of energy that transports the party and Filbert into the dungeon beneath the city. The party finds themselves in the midst of a twisting labyrinth of corridors and chambers, filled with traps, puzzles, and monsters. They must navigate their way through the dungeon and find a way to escape, all while trying to avoid the dangers that lurk within.

As the party explores the dungeon, they begin to uncover clues and information about the Celestial Keystone, a powerful magical artifact that is rumored to be hidden within the dungeon. The party must decide whether to continue their quest for the Keystone, or to turn back and find a way out of the dungeon. They must also decide whether to trust Filbert and follow his lead, or to strike out on their own and try to find the entrance to the dungeon. -->

## Chapter 2
### The City of Arvandor
:
&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a good opportunity for the PCs to rest and regroup, but honestly it would be hilarious if they just immediately started looking for the labyrinth.
:
&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway, here's a good table of things that'll happen to them as they wander through town.
::
#### Looking for Trouble
| 1d6 |&nbsp;&nbsp;|                   |
|----:|:-:|:------------------|
|   1 |&nbsp;| The PC with the lowest Passive Perception is pick-pocketted while walking past a beggar. Only the player with the highest Passive Perception may roll a Perception (WIS) check against a DC of 12 to notice. They then confront a low-level Thief. |
|   2 |&nbsp;| The PC with the lowest Charisma bonus is approached by a stranger, who challenges them to a game of chance. They can choose to play the game (which they cannot win, it's rigged), costing 1 gp per attempt, or they can confront the low-level Thief. |
|   3 |&nbsp;| The shopkeeper Thaddeus Stein at the Thaddeus's Baked Goods chases a low-level thief out into the street. The thief has stolen a (magical) golden ladle that can create food in its spoon three times a day. |
|   4 |&nbsp;| A town guardsman stops the party -- or the most suspicious member of the party -- and asks for papers. Failure to prove their legitimacy or the discovery of stolen goods could get the PC taken to the prison. If they can actually prove their identity, the guard dismisses this evidence as forgery and takes them to prison anyway. |
|   5 |&nbsp;| The party comes across an old woman who is crying. She just looked down into her basket and saw that all of the nice expensive cloth she just bought had disappeared! She can't remember how long it might have been gone, but if the players can beat a DC 15 Investigation (INT) check they can find the low-level thief, who has the old woman's fancy cloth. |
|   6 |&nbsp;| A group of buskers are playing music and juggling on the corner of the street. There is are two low-level thieves in the crowd that has gathered, and the PC with the highest Passive Perception spots them picking pockets. |

### Savor the Flavor
:
&nbsp;&nbsp;As the players shmooze with Cavendish's band of misfits, they may befriend **Chopper**, the ship's cook. 
:
&nbsp;&nbsp;A monolithic pillar of pale green muscle in an apron, Chopper is all bark and no bite. With a personal code of honor and loyalty, he trusts the Captain's judgement of the PCs and his decision to invite them on their quest. The players may not have to spend much time trying to build rapport with Chopper before he might invite the adventurers to help him gather ingredients for a dinner he's planning for a special guest!
:
&nbsp;&nbsp;Chopper is a connoisseur of spice and exotic flavors, having traveled the world to build his discerning pallet. He has a very specific flavor in mind, so he has a shopping list. 
::::
{{note
##### The Spice Pit
This shop is run by **Zarya**, a fiery red dragonborn who specializes in rare and spicy spices.

This shop is run by a group of friendly halflings who specialize in fresh and exotic fruits and vegetables.

#### The Spice Pit
:
&nbsp;&nbsp;As the party walks into **The Spice Pit**, they are immediately overwhelmed by the pungent and aromatic smells of a wide variety of spices. The air is thick with the scents of cinnamon, cumin, turmeric, and many others unfamiliar. The walls of the shop are lined with shelves packed with small, brightly-colored glass jars and bottles. The shop is small and cramped, and the shelves are so close together that it is difficult to move around without bumping into something. The floor is covered in a thick layer of dust and spice residue, and the air is hazy with the swirling fumes of the various spices.
:
&nbsp;&nbsp;As the party enters, the shopkeeper slithers from behind the counter, silently passing between the shelves which seem far too close for her to fit without knocking everything over. Zarya is a fierce and fiery red dragonborn with a sharp, angular face and piercing green eyes. She is dressed in a simple tunic and trousers. She introduces herself.

#### Exotic Herbs & Spices
:
**Dragonfire pepper flakes**. These fiery flakes are made from the dried and ground pods of a rare and spicy pepper that grows only in the volcanic regions of Zarya’s homeland. Eating a teaspoon of pepper flakes deals (1d6) fire damage to the eater and grants a one-time-use breath weapon (fire) that must be used within three rounds.
:
**Fairy dust**. This shimmering, sparkling spice is made from the ground-up wings of rare and elusive faeries. It has a nutty, floral warmth. Eating a teaspoon will make the eater unusually warm, granting them an immunity to cold-related effects for 24 hours. It'll make you miserable in the Summer though.
:
**Shadow Salt**. This rare and mysterious spice is said to be harvested from the shadows of the underworld. It has a dark and smoky flavor, and is often used to add depth and complexity to savory dishes. Some say that it has the power to shadowstep those who consume it, allowing them to move through the shadows as if they were a part of them.
:
**Starlight Sugar**. This sparkling and shimmering sugar is made from the ground-up petals of rare and exotic flowers that grow only in the most magical and enchanted gardens. It has a sweet and floral flavor, and is often used to add a touch of magic to desserts and baked goods. Some say that it has the power to grant wishes to those who consume it, allowing them to make their wildest dreams come true.
:
**Arcane oregano.** This rare and mysterious herb is said to be grown in the hidden gardens of the wizarding academies. It has a pungent and aromatic flavor, and is often used to season meats and vegetables. Some say that it has the power to enhance magical abilities in those who consume it, allowing them to cast more powerful spells and perform more advanced feats of magic.

<!--
The Produce Patch is a small and colorful shop filled with an array of fresh and exotic fruits and vegetables. The shelves are lined with baskets overflowing with vibrant and unusual produce, ranging from bright and colorful dragonfruit to strange and exotic jackfruit. The air is thick with the sweet and earthy smells of the various fruits and vegetables, and the shop is bustling with activity as customers of all shapes and sizes haggle and bargain over the freshest and most flavorful produce.

The proprietor of The Produce Patch is a friendly and outgoing halfling named Pip. Pip is a plump and cheerful halfling with a round, rosy face and a wild mop of curly hair. He is always smiling and chatting with his customers, and he takes great pride in the quality and variety of his produce.
-->

#### The Produce Patch 
:
&nbsp;&nbsp;**Pip** the halfling spots Chopper as the party walks across the threshold into the open-air produce market. He stops himself mid-conversation with a customer to sprint and leap over a basket of turnips. He rushes up to the group and greets Chopper excited. 
:
&nbsp;&nbsp;"You made it, you made it!! And you brought friends — welcome to the Produce Patch," he says with a flourish. He turns back to Chopper. 
:
&nbsp;&nbsp;"How did it go? Did you find it?" he bounces up and down, now ignoring the rest of the party. 
:
&nbsp;&nbsp;Chopper smirks and reaches into his bag. He produces a thin rectangular object wrapped in paper. At a glance a PC may see that there are strange glyphs on the paper. A magically-inclined player character would assume they were arcane in nature, but detect magic would reveal nothing.
:
&nbsp;&nbsp;It's a chocolate bar. Pick your favorite (or, if it's funny, your *least* favorite). Chopper won't elaborate about how he got it.

#### Exotic Produce
:
**Enchanted Apples**. Stays fresh for a very long time. Eating more than half of one will make you appear significantly younger for 24 hours to everyone.
:
**Magic Mushrooms**. Believed to have magical properties that enhance psychic abilities and promote spiritual enlightenment in those who consume them.
:
**Enchanted Peaches**. Have magical properties that grant the ability to fly to those who consume them. In game terms, eating an enchanted peach grants the ability to fly for a short period of time, similar to the effects of the fly spell.
:
**Magic Melons**. Grant the ability to breathe underwater to those who consume them. In game terms, eating a magic melon could grant the ability to breathe underwater for a short period of time, similar to the effects of the water breathing spell.
:
**Magic Potatoes**. Rumored to have magical properties that grant the ability to move through solid earth. In game terms, eating a magic potato grants Earthwalk for half an hour.
:
**Golden Trowel**. Grants its wielder the ability to intuit the wants and desires of nearby plants. Also grants an intuition and even a compulsion todig up lost coins or other old valuables that are in nearby loose soil.
:
**Basket of Awareness**. Once completing the attunement ritual, the owner can feel the entire inside and contents of the basket as long as it is within 300 feet. This is so that you will always know how much of what items or material is in it. If an intelligent creature is inside the basket, it works like a telepathic walkie-talkie!
:
**Feywild Carrots**. Shriveled old carrots. Don't taste very good. Grants the eater the ability to see in the dark, but extreme light sensitivity.

<!--
The Arcane Butchery is a bustling and aromatic shop filled with a wide variety of exotic and unusual meats. The walls are adorned with racks of cured and smoked meats, and the air is thick with the heady scents of spices and cooking. The shop is busy with customers of all shapes and sizes, haggling and bargaining over the freshest and most flavorful cuts of meat.

The owner of The Arcane Butchery is a gruff and no-nonsense orc named Grondar. Grondar is a large and imposing orc with bulging muscles and a fierce expression. He is known for his excellent selection of meats, and his prices are always fair.

"Welcome to The Arcane Butchery," Grondar says, as the party enters the shop. "I'm Grondar, the owner. What can I do for you today?"

### A Magician's Mishap

&nbsp;&nbsp;After the PCs have had a chance to screw off and look for trouble once or twice, they come across what at first they see as a busker setting up a demonstration. After sticking around for a minute they discover that the demo is actually for a complex spell that an amateur magician is preparing to cast. 
:
&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyone with passing Arcane knowledge can tell that the sigil lines are too jagged, the ingredients that the magician has laid out are too scant and of poor quality, and it's not even the right time of day to be doing sigil work anyway (overcast, mid-day, the day after a New Moon, etc).
:
&nbsp;&nbsp;The PCs can choose to help Filbert or not, either way, at some point in their encounter, he will initiate the spell.

&nbsp;&nbsp;When Filbert's spell goes off, an explosion throws all the players off their feet. When the players open their eyes, they're in the dark.

>

>
