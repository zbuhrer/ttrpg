However the PCs know each other, they are eventually approached by a grizzled character in a tattered tri-corner hat. He wears a cape and cowl that don't hide the trappings of a pirate. He introduces himself as **[[../../Creatures/NPCs/Captain Hector Cavendish#Statblock|Captain Hector Cavendish]]** of the Serpent Star. He noticed the PCs equipment from across the tavern floor and thought he might have found just who he was looking for...

Captain Cavendish reveals that twenty years ago, when he was a young adventurer himself... he was hired to find an powerful and dangerous artifact: **[[The Celestial Keystone]]**. To this day he has not succeeded in his quest.

Many have joined his tireless quest over the years and either died or left when it seemed clear that the quest was impossible.

### Oh Shit! Skeletons!

If a player is outside, any Passive Perception above a 5 would notice the clattering of loose bones and rusty armor as a seemingly unending horde of skeletons slowly begin to creep up from the shoreline. If the party is all still inside, they may hear a scream from the street or if they're particularly drunk or unobservant a skeleton might just crash through the window by their table!

The undead climb up over the wood of the dock, they shamble up the rocky shore, inland from seemingly every direction, the town is beset by [[../../../../5eSRD/Monsters/Skeleton|skeletons]]. 

### The Lich Arathax

The players are unable to discern any motives from the skeletons by magical means or otherwise. Enough skeletons will engage the players in order to keep them occupied, the rest of the skeletons will search the town.

With a sufficient **[[../../../../5eSRD/Gameplay/Abilities#Skills|Investigation]]** roll, a player may notice that the skulls of the skeletons are marked with a sigil. Captain Cavendish would recognize it as the Sigil of Arathax, a Lich who hasn't been seen in decades. He was once freed from his icy prison by adventurers who sought his power and it took several powerful wizards to get him back under lock and key. He hadn't been seen or heard from since. At least, until now.

The Captain may be willing to admit that the reason he's in this town in the first place is because he was following a lead; there's a rumor that a map to where the Keystone is hidden was drawn by a local in this village after having a prophetic dream.

It's true, this did happen. Barnaby, a local just psychically sensitive enough recieved a prophetic dream warning of an apocalypse, skeletons rising from the sea, and of a great stone doorway being destroyed. He wrote all of this down, even doodling a crude map, and took it to the library late last night. In the basement of the library is a chest which the PCs will have to open to find Barnaby'a prophecy.

The librarian and the tavern barkeep know about Barnaby's prophecy, but Barnaby himself is slain in the skeleton attack (looking any deeper would show that he killed himself before the skeletons could drag him away). 

Reading the map reveals through some unwrittenly cryptic means that the Keystone can be found in/through a mythical labyrinth beneath a city that someone with regional knowledge will recognize was changed to Arvandor 200 years ago.

The Captain plots a course for the Capital.
