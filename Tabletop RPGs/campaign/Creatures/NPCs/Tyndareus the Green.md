> ***Shapechanger.*** The doppelganger can use its action to polymorph into a Small or Medium humanoid it has seen, or back into its true form. Its statistics, other than its size, are the same in each form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn't transformed. It reverts to its true form if it dies.  
>  
> ***Ambusher.*** The doppelganger has advantage on attack rolls against any creature it has surprised.  
>  
> ***Surprise Attack.*** If the doppelganger surprises a creature and hits it with an attack during the first round of combat, the target takes an extra 10 (3d6) damage from the attack.  
>  
> ***Immutable Form.*** The doppelganger is immune to any spell or effect that would alter its form.  
>  
> ***Amorphous.*** The doppelganger can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing by changing the shape and density of its body.  
> ### Actions  
> ***Multiattack.*** The doppelganger makes two melee attacks.  
>  
> ***Slam.*** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 7 (1d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage.  
>  
> ***Read Thoughts.*** The doppelganger magically reads the surface thoughts of one creature within 60 ft. of it. The effect can penetrate barriers, but 3 ft. of wood or dirt, 2 ft. of stone, 2 inches of metal, or a thin sheet of lead blocks it. While the target is in range, the doppelganger can continue reading its thoughts, as long as the doppelganger's concentration isn't broken (as if concentrating on a spell). While reading the target's mind, the doppelganger has advantage on Wisdom (Insight) and Charisma (Deception, Intimidation, and Persuasion) checks against the target.

## Appearance
Tall and thin, with a long white beard. He looks like a cartoon wizard.

### Clothing
He wears several overlapping layers of robe-like materials, almost appearing to be wearing too many clothes at once. There are folds and pockets all over, and they are each a different shade of green. 

## Character

### Personality

He appears to be a silly old man. He claims to have forgotten more spells than he's ever known. If asked about his relationship with [[Qrem]], he may pretend to have difficulty recalling the creature's name. 

> [!warning] The Lie
> In actuality, Tyndareus is a [[../../5eSRD/Monsters/Doppelganger|Doppelganger]] with a mutually beneficial, long-term contract with [[Qrem]]. 
> 
> Their true personality is not unlike the silly old man they pretend to be, however far more flamboyantly. There is no mind-control at play here, they're in it for the love of the game. The green wizardly character is actually their favorite and most used form to take, so "Tyndareus The Green" is well known in the area for his quirky and aloof mannerisms, which Tyndareus the Shifter knows how to work to his advantage.

### Motives - Goals

Tyndareus's arrangement with [[Qrem]] involves finding and obtaining fiendish artifacts. In exchange, Qrem has promised to get him an audience with his patron Demon Lord, Mephistopheles. 

> [!warning] The Lie
> If a PC can read [[../../5eSRD/Characterizations/Languages#^12caa3|Infernal]] (Tyndareus can't) and succeed a DC 12 [[../../5eSRD/Gameplay/Abilities#Skills|Arcana]] check, they may notice that in the contract (should they even be allowed to read it) only stays <u>a</u> demon lord. Not Qrem's patron specifically. 
> 
> The imp's plan is to fulfill the contract by granting Tyndareus an audience with a much less... sane or accepting patron. (see [[../../Plot/Quests/04 Qrem's Qualm|Qrem's Qualm]])

### Values - Ideals

Tyndareus does not have very complex values. Their greed for power and wealth sets them apart from their normally unaligned fellow [[../../5eSRD/Monsters/Doppelganger|Doppelgangers]], and they pride themself on their ability to weigh costs and risks.

## History

Tyndareus left their tiny community at a young age when it was found by local humans who sought to eradicate them. They've been solitary ever since. Early on, they were corrupted and taken advantage of by [[Qrem]], an Imp who coerced them into a contract of servitude. 

The Doppelganger seeks an audience with an ancient evil powerful enough to bestow great power onto them. They believe that the deeds they do to secure fiendish artifacts for Qrem are tokens of servitude to his Patron Mephistopheles.

When Tyndareus sends the party to [[../../Plot/Quests/The Bakery|The Bakery]] for Grammy's Apple Pie recipe, what he doesn't tell them is that the recipe... [[../../Lore/Grammy's Apple Pie Recipe| is an evil imp artifact]].
