>___  
> ***Shapechanger.*** The imp can use its action to polymorph into a beast form that resembles a rat (speed 20 ft.), a raven (20 ft., fly 60 ft.), or a spider (20 ft., climb 20 ft.), or back into its true form. Its statistics are the same in each form, except for the speed changes noted. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn't transformed. It reverts to its true form if it dies.  
>  
> ***Devil's Sight.*** Magical darkness doesn't impede the imp's darkvision.  
>  
> ***Magic Resistance.*** The imp has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.  
>  
> ***Variant: Familiar.*** The imp can serve another creature as a familiar, forming a telepathic bond with its willing master. While the two are bonded, the master can sense what the imp senses as long as they are within 1 mile of each other. While the imp is within 10 feet of its master, the master shares the imp's Magic Resistance trait. At any time and for any reason, the imp can end its service as a familiar, ending the telepathic bond.  
> ### Actions  
> ***Sting (Bite in Beast Form).*** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 5 (1d4 + 3) piercing damage, and the target must make on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.  
>  
> ***Invisibility.*** The imp magically turns invisible until it attacks, or until its concentration ends (as if concentrating on a spell). Any equipment the imp wears or carries is invisible with it.

## Appearance
Qrem is tiny, even by Imp standards, standing less than eight inches tall. Players may compare him to an action figure, but beware picking him up. His long tail is barbed with a poison stinger, and the only thing he hates more than being perceived is being grabbed.

### Clothing
Qrem is often completely naked. 

## Character

### Personality
- Quiet 
- Untrusting 
- In service of Mephistopheles 

### Motives - Goals
- **The Big Secret.** Having tricked his Summoner, Qrem is a player of the long con. He has survived for centuries corrupting mortals all over the material plane, chiefly his own Master, who has spent eons being driven mad in a pocket dimension segregated from time itself. (see: [[../../Plot/Quests/03 Qrem's Qualm|Qrem's Qualm]]). 
- Qrem is a collector of Devil, Fiend, and other Imp artifacts. He has been disconnected from his home and his own culture for centuries. Any means of staying connected with it is important to him, even if it involves finding artifacts that are less than savory to material mortals. ^f60929

> "I like treasures that remind me of home..."

### Values - Ideals
An older version of Qrem was very selfish, and he understands that his selfishness and brash lack of danger-sense is what got him in his predicament in the first place (see: [[../../Plot/Quests/03 Qrem's Qualm|Qrem's Qualm]]). 
  
Qrem is more careful now. He knows that corrupting mortals in the short term has its own reward, but the sweetest treats are worth the wait and the long con is his playground. He has a keen and objective, first hand experience walking mortals to their own graves at the expense of their own souls being traded to Mephistopheles. 

He remembers a time when he would relish the opportunity to corrupt a mortal, but now that Qrem is older and wiser, he has learned the value of mortal lives and how temporary and fleeting they may be. Corrupting them isn't a quick trip, and the long con is his playground. Being a [[#^f60929|collector of fiendish artifacts]] which are difficult to come by and often punishable by local constabularies to own, his biggest flaw is his willingness to abandon loyalty for a trinket to bring back to the infernal plane. Everything he's ever collected is in his [[../../Lore/Qrem's Devil Bag|Devil Bag]].

### Flaws

> [!attention] [[#^f60929|The Fiendish Collector]]
> If the Imp has any reason to believe that a player character has a fiendish artifact, he will stop at almost nothing to get it. He will at first make increasingly large offers, including familiar servitude, and eventually may try to steal it if he does not come to trust the player character. It would be very difficult to convince Qrem that he does *not* actually need what he wants.

## History
Hundreds of years ago, Qrem was summoned to the material plane by a powerful Sorcerer in a band of adventurers. The purpose he was summoned for was to steal an ancient magical crystal from a lost temple in a remote jungle. 

Although Qrem was able to successfully pinch the pricy gem for the party, the Guardian of the Temple appeared and... one by one the party was vanquished! 

> "Until only I and my Master remained!" recounts Qrem. 

The Summoner managed to use the magic of the Chronos Crystal to freeze his own spirit in time, beyond the material veil. The part that Qrem often leaves out is that... *it was his idea!* He knew that because of the tricky nuances with summoning [[../../5eSRD/Monsters/Imp (Devil)|Imps]], the loophole would allow him to remain in the material plane indefinitely, as long as his Master's soul remained imprisoned.
