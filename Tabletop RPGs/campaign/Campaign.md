# Let's Begin

This campaign is based on Jennifer Adcock's [[DRA21_GrammysCountryApplePie.pdf|Grammy's Country Apple Pie]] story. Her story has been... creatively twisted. It will start much the same (with very little language from [[Plot/Quests/01 Introduction#Detailed Description|the introductory chapter]] changed), with the players being prompted to accept a cute recipe-fetching quest for [[Creatures/NPCs/Tyndareus the Green|Tyndareus the Green]] a Bakery overrun by goblins. 

I have taken that plotline and added twists that should pivot this into a campaign befitting a party of all alignments, especially beginning at level 1.
