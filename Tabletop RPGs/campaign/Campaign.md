> #### Introduction: 
> When the ancient wizard Tyndareus develops a craving for a special treat from his childhood, he will stop at nothing to get his hands on the best apple pie in the whole world. He hires a group of adventurers to seek out the bakery that once produced the wonderful dessert – unfortunately for them, the bakery has long since been overrun by goblins. But all is not as it seems at Grammy’s Bakery, and Tyndareus isn’t the only one who’d do anything for those pies.

# STOP! 

## An Important Note Before You Start:

All combat situations in this encounter are avoidable, whether by stealth, negotiation, deception, bribery, cleverness, or good old-fashioned running away. If a combat is initiated that the players no longer wish to participate in, any combat situation can be de-escalated with a DC 13 Charisma or Wisdom check, along with a plan or alternative solution from a player character. 

With the exception of running away, “defeating” a foe in any of these manners will still count for XP gained. Pacifistic approaches are completely valid here, and it may be a good idea to remind your players of this at the beginning of the session. You may also choose, by your own discretion, to have combatant monsters and NPCs attempt to de-escalate the situation.
