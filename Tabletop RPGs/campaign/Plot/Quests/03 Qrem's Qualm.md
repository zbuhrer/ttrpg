# Qrem's Qualm

## Triggers
The party has just delivered the recipe for a delicious apple pie to [[../../Creatures/NPCs/Tyndareus the Green|Tyndareus the Green]].
## Objectives
- Qrem's Purpose 
	- Hundreds of years ago, Qrem was summoned to the material plane by a Sorcerer 
	- Qrem tricked the Sorcerer into "saving himself" by sealing his own soul into the crystal, separating it from time itself. 
		- This made a sort of loophole in the Imp's contract and now he's stuck here until the contract is violated or cancelled by the Summoner or until the terms are completed.
		- Centuries have passed outside of the pocket dimension; eons inside.

## Detailed Description

###  The Grove of Time
> [[../../Creatures/NPCs/Qrem|Qrem]] quickly opens the door to Tyndareus's tower. He holds onto the edge of the door and the frame, and he looks afraid as he's barely able to hold it open.
> 
> He looks surprised and a little disappointed to see you, as if he were expecting someone else. He may even look over your shoulder to see if the person he's looking for might be behind you. After a moment he whispers, "Hurry up! I can't hold this door open for very long!"

An average DC 12 [[../../5eSRD/Gameplay/Abilities#Skills|Perception]] check for the players to notice that they cannot see the room behind the imp. Instead of the usual cluttered stone room, with papers and bottles and wizardly garbage strewn about, it is inky blackness. A single DC 18 [[../../5eSRD/Gameplay/Abilities#Skills|Arcana]] check (or if a character has a way to see through magical darkness, such as with Devil's Sight), they may recognize this particular shade of inky blackness as being temporal in nature.

If the player's accept Qrem's invitation inside, they feel a disorienting sensation and quickly find themselves standing in the heart of an ancient grove. Towering trees with gnarled branches stretch upwards, their thick bunches of leaves disappearing formlessly into the thick fog. The air is heavy with the scent of earth and magic, carrying a sense of ancient mystery. 

No matter what time of day it was when the players passed through door, the thick fog is weirdly bright â€” as if bright sunlight were diffused throughout the thick fog from every direction. However, a DC 15 [[../../5eSRD/Gameplay/Abilities#Skills|Perception]] check after (-1 for every hour spent in the Grove) would allow a player to discern that time is not passing in the grove, and the source of the light, even through the fog, appears to be everywhere.

> Standing in the middle of the grove's clearing is Qrem. He cowers and slinks through the fallen leaves and tall grass to the nearest adventurer and cautiously explains the predicament.
> 
> "My former Master made this... place," Qrem sneers up at the sunlight streaming through the canopy above. "His solitude over the centuries has made him powerful, even without a physical form."

### 0 - The Grove Maze 

The grove is a maze that must be followed in order, or it will start over. It should be kinda like the Lost Woods, but don't literally do that. Throw some fun D&D things in there, especially if it involves illusory magic? 

At some point the party notices that the terrain has changed to a more jungle aesthetic. Qrem may announce that he recognizes it, if he has given any (even false) exposition on his own backstory. 

### 1 - The Temple
