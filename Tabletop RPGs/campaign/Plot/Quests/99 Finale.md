## Detailed Description
Read the following aloud if the party brings the complete recipe back to Tyndareus:

> “The old man’s face lights up as he reads through the recipe. ‘Of course, of course! It all makes sense,’ he says. He uses Mending to repair the torn parchment and gives it to his imp servant to make one immediately. He rummages in a drawer for a moment, then emerges with a rust-colored leather bag. ‘I think you’ll find that quite entertaining,’ he says, with a twinkle in his eye. He also gives you 25 gold pieces, in a smaller, plain bag. As the imp returns impossibly fast with a wonderful smelling pie, Tyndareus offers to share with you. It is, indeed, the tastiest apple pie you’ve ever had the pleasure to eat.”

The rust-colored bag is a Bag of Tricks, which is of course, fun. If they do not retrieve the whole recipe, Tyndareus informs them that this is only half the recipe, and they’ll have to go back for the rest. If they tell him that it is impossible, or if they quit, he is disappointed, but resigned to his pie-less fate.
