### Qrem's Devil Bag

_Wondrous item, very rare_

This simple bag of holding has been corrupted by the Infernal sigil that has been carved on it. It is a version of an invisibility sigil that is tied to [[../Creatures/NPCs/Qrem|Qrem]] himself. When touched by any creature, the bag becomes invisible. However, if it is invisible, creatures with Devil's Sight can see it glowing... even through walls!

#### Contents

Roll 1d20 against the following table. You can only pull one item out of the bag at a time. 

| 1d20 | Item
|--:|---
| 1 | A small, black imp skull that can be used as a focus for necromantic magic.
| 2 | A pair of brass knuckles that are actually the severed hands of a [[../5eSRD/Monsters/Rakshasa\|Rakshasa]].
| 3 | A potion that, when drunk, allows the user to [[../5eSRD/Spells/Speak with Animals\|Speak with Animals]] for 1 hour.
| 4 | [[#^d9d1a8\|The Ancient Imp's Sword]].
| 5 | A wand that casts the spell "[[../5eSRD/Spells/Charm Person\|Charm Person]]" 3 times per day.
| 6 | A dagger that is actually a [[../5eSRD/Monsters/Mimic\|Mimic]]. It has been alone in the bag for a long time and will emotionally bond with whomever next pulls it out. Consider making an NPC for it, this sounds like fun.
| 7 | [[#^4c7f30\|A handful of imps teeth]]. This may be pulled more than once. [[../Creatures/NPCs/Qrem\|Qrem]]'s been collecting these for centuries!
| 8 | A mirror that shows the user's true form, even if they are disguised.
| 9 | [[#^640481\|Dice of Prophecy]].

| 14 | [[#^9a15ba\|The Ring of Mimicry]].
| 15 | [[#^fd1d22\|The Book of Forbidden Knowledge]].
| 16 | [[#^8f9b16\|The Book of Infernal Recipes]]. [[Grammy's Apple Pie Recipe]] is a page torn from this book.
| 17 | A cloak that grants the wearer the ability to become invisible.
| 18 | An ordinary ring shaped like a coiled serpent. There is a space where a signet should be, but it appears blank.
| 19 | An empty potion bottle with a pewter-molded stopper in the shape of an imp. 
| 20 | A very tiny wand (like the size of a toothpick) that casts the spell "[[../5eSRD/Spells/Fireball\|Fireball]]" (as if it were full size) 5 times per day.
