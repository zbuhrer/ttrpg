### Qrem's Devil Bag

_Wondrous item, very rare_

This simple bag of holding has been corrupted by the Infernal sigil that has been carved on it. It is a version of an invisibility sigil that is tied to [[../Creatures/NPCs/Qrem|Qrem]] himself. When touched by any creature, the bag becomes invisible. However, if it is invisible, creatures with Devil's Sight can see it glowing... even through walls!
