### Grammy's Apple Pie Recipe

_Wondrous item, very rare_

This single sheet of paper, scrawled with infernal characters was torn in half to prevent its magic from being used. It was... poorly separated though. It can be found in [[../Plot/Quests/02 To The Bakery|The Bakery]] after talking to [[../Creatures/NPCs/Tyndareus the Green|Tyndareus the Green]].

Separated, the two halves of the sheet don't appear to do anything, and don't appear to be magical at all. However, when they are held together, they will magically join and the infernal symbols will glow and burn in the holder's hands. They must succeed a DC 10 [[../../5eSRD/Gameplay/Abilities#Skills|Reflex]] save to avoid taking 1d6 fire damage to their hands (and possibly burning them). 

If a player can read Infernal, they can tell that it is a real and intentional recipe for apple pie, however it has sigils and incantations scrawled in the margins and between the lines, in various handwritings. When followed correctly and spoken aloud, the incantations written around the recipe will imbue the apple pies with a magic which makes it irresistible and makes anyone who eats it highly suggestible.

This page was originally torn from [[Qrem's Devil Bag#^8f9b16|The Book of Infernal Recipes]].
