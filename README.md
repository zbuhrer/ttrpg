# Project: Echoes of Elysium TTRPG System
## Overview
This project implements an AI-driven tabletop RPG system using Streamlit and Ollama.

## Current Status

The project is currently in the early stages of development, focusing on core infrastructure and initial UI/UX setup.

**Completed/Partially Completed:**
*   **Phase 1: Core Infrastructure:**
    *   Project Structure Setup: Basic module organization is in place, but tasks like setting up the testing framework, implementing the logging system, and creating the documentation structure are still pending.
    *   State Management System: Design of state classes is complete.
*   **Phase 4: UI/UX Development:**
    *   Main Interface: Navigation system, component layout, and theme implementation are complete. Responsive design is still a TODO.

**Incomplete Phases:** Phases 2 (AI Integration), 3 (Game Systems), 5 (Storage & Persistence), 6 (Testing & Optimization), 7 (Production Preparation), and 8 (Polish & Launch) are largely incomplete.

**Next Steps:**
*   Complete the remaining tasks under Project Structure Setup (testing framework, logging, documentation) and State Management System (implement state transitions, add state validation, create state persistence).
*   Begin work on the Game Engine Core, focusing on the turn management system, action resolution framework, and event dispatch system.
*   Start the Ollama Setup (Phase 2), including connection management, error handling, response parsing, and context management.
*   Implement responsive design for the Main Interface (Phase 4).

## System Architecture
- Frontend: Streamlit web interface
- Backend: Python-based game engine
- AI: Ollama for narrative generation
- Storage: File-based with JSON serialization

## Component Dependencies
- Core Engine → State Management
- State Management → Save System
- AI Integration → Core Engine
- UI Components → State Management

## Technical Requirements
1. Python 3.8+
2. Streamlit 1.10+
3. Ollama API endpoint
4. Access to file system for saves

## Development Environment
- VS Code with Python extension
- Git for version control
- Virtual environment
- Local Ollama instance

## Data Flow
1. User Interface → Action Handler
2. Action Handler → Game Engine
3. Game Engine → AI Generator
4. AI Generator → State Manager
5. State Manager → User Interface

## API Endpoints
- /api/generate: Ollama story generation
- /api/save: Game state persistence
- /api/load: Game state restoration

## Testing Strategy
1. Unit tests for core logic
2. Integration tests for AI
3. UI tests with Streamlit
4. Save/load verification

## Deployment Strategy
1. Local development setup
2. Containerized testing
3. Production deployment
4. Monitoring implementation

## Performance Requirements
- < 2s response for AI generation
- < 1s for state updates
- < 100ms for UI updates
- < 5s for save/load
